# NeuroFocus

NeuroFocus is a single-channel EEG acquisition system designed for researchers and developers. It uses the ADS1220 24-bit ADC and ESP32-S3 for high-quality neural signal capture.

## What is NeuroFocus?

NeuroFocus captures electrical brain activity through electrodes. The system amplifies weak signals and converts them to digital data you can analyze.

The latest version (V4) supports both Bluetooth Low Energy and USB Serial communication.

## Key Features

- **High Resolution**: 24-bit ADC with 660 SPS sampling
- **Low Noise**: AD8422 instrumentation amplifier with 100x gain
- **Wireless**: BLE support for remote monitoring
- **Compact**: Custom PCB for Seeed Xiao ESP32-S3
- **Open Source**: Full firmware and hardware files available

## Who Should Use This?

NeuroFocus is for:

- Researchers studying brain signals
- Developers building neural interfaces
- Students learning about EEG systems
- Makers exploring biofeedback projects

## Repository Structure

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with V4 firmware:

1. Install PlatformIO
2. Connect your ESP32-S3 board
3. Build and upload the firmware
4. Start streaming EEG data

See the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide for details.

## Hardware Versions

| Version | Channels | Features | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| V4 | 1 | BLE + Serial | **Current** |
| V3 | 1 | Serial only | Legacy |
| V2 | 3 | BLE | Legacy |
| V1 | 1 | Basic | Legacy |

## System Architecture

NeuroFocus has two main parts:

1. **Hardware**: PCB with amplifier and ADC
2. **Firmware**: ESP32 code for data acquisition

The system captures EEG signals at the electrodes, amplifies them 100x through the AD8422, and digitizes them with the ADS1220. The ESP32-S3 processes and streams the data via BLE or USB.
